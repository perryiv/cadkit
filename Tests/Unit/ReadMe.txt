Tests of a particular class or function in isolation.

Ideally these tests are automated, fast, and require no inspection of output to determine if the test worked (output a status code).
If an error occured information is printed to help determine the location of the error.

I think we should try to converge the units tests to use the Google unit testing framework (http://code.google.com/p/googletest/).
