              Minerva was born out of a need for multi-screen, view-frustum
              corrected, planet-wide management and inquiry of geospatially
              referenced data of all kinds.
              This includes satellite images, terrain, temporal vector data,
              temporal volumetric data, and standard GIS "shape" data, loaded
              either from disk, spatial databases, or internet protocols.

              Further, a lot of non-traditional geospatial data is
              underground, such as groundwater data and urban infrastructure.
              Minerva is a platform flexible enough to display data below the surface.

              Minerva's primary strength is the ability to display raster and vector data together
              from multiple sources with the benefit of high-performance computer graphics.
              By managing level-of-detail through distance-based tile-splitting, 
              Minerva can easily display large terrain and image repositories.
