This project is provided for one purpose, to allow developers to compile 
CadKit libraries and executables that depend on OpenGL Performer (from SGI).

Obviously, the generated executables will not do anything useful. The intent is
to allow the developer to work on a PC (i.e., using Visual C++) and then 
recompile on Irix or Linux without any changes to the source code.
