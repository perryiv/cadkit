Introduction:
Thanks for trying out OsgTools. Hopefully these examples will show how
easy it is to use OpenSceneGraph, and show that OsgTools provides useful
classes for your development.

Install:
Make sure you have the following variables set:
OSGTOOLS_INC_DIR
OSGTOOLS_LIB_DIR

An example of each could be:

OSGTOOLS_INC_DIR = C:\sdk\src
(where C:\sdk\src\OsgTools exists)

and

OSGTOOLS_LIB_DIR = C:\sdk\src\lib
(where C:\sdk\src\lib contains OsgTools.lib)

Running:
You will want to have your 'Path' environment variable appended to reflect
the location of the OsgTools.dll if you are running on windows.

An example of the addition path needed might be:
C:\sdk\src\bin

If you are running on Linux, you will want to append your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
to reflect the location of OsgTools.so.  Similarly on IRIX, your LD_LIBRARY32_PATH should be appended.


Good luck.  Please visit http://cadkit.sourceforge.net to find more information
