  Minerva is an end-user application that unifies several existing GIS tools with 
  high-performance, planet-wide 3D visualization. At the core, Minerva is 
  a Windows desktop program that follows the document-view paradigm – with 
  the ability to open multiple documents at once – and uses a plugin architecture 
  for extensible design. Minerva also has multi-screen, virtual reality display 
  capability, which can be thought of as another view to the document.

  Using the Windows desktop application, the user queries for information from 
  a variety of sources, including: WMS servers, postGIS databases, and the file 
  system. Minerva keeps track of these "layers" using a collection of abstract 
  base classes. Communication with the multi-screen display occurs via XML-based 
  serialization and deserialization of these layer objects through a specialized 
  table in a designated postGIS database. Minerva's primary strength is the ability 
  to display raster and vector data together from multiple sources with the benefit 
  of high-performance computer graphics (including animating through temporal data 
  sets). By using robust open source toolkits like

  we are able to manage gigabytes worth of terrain and image layers.

  Minerva is an open-source project under active development at 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asu.edu">Arizona State University</a>'s 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://dt.asu.edu">Decision Theater</a>, 
  and is used in our production facility to support policy decision-making meetings 
  for our customers. Projects completed with Minerva vary from 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/perryiv/ScottsdaleUnifiedSchoolDistrict">school enrollment</a>
  to 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/perryiv/WestNileVirus">disease propagation</a>
  studies.

<p>

  The program is written with platform independent C++.
